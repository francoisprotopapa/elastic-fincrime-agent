# 🎬 Live Demo Scenarios: The "Top-Down" Investigation

This document outlines the demo flow. We start with a **General Discovery** (Acting as a Chief Risk Officer) to find threats, and then **Deep Dive** into specific cases based on the AI's findings.

## ⚠️ Pre-requisites
1.  **Agent:** Select "Financial Crime Investigator".
2.  **Time Picker:** Set to **"Last 1 Year"** (Critical: Data covers May-July 2024).

## 🌍 PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (The Morning Briefing)
**Context:** It's Monday morning. You act as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). You don't have a specific target; you want the AI to tell you what the biggest threats are right now across the entire bank.

### 📋 The Prompt
> **"Act as the Chief Risk Officer. Perform a comprehensive threat scan across all transaction logs from May to July 2024.**
>
> **Your goal is to identify the TOP 3 most critical financial crime patterns currently active in our system.**
>
> **EXECUTE THIS STRATEGY:**
> **1. BROAD SCAN:** Search logs for high-risk semantic keywords (e.g., 'Structuring', 'Sanctions', 'Trafficking', 'Identity').
> **2. VERIFY:** For every suspicious entity found, briefly cross-reference with External News.
> **3. REPORT:** List the Top 3 threats found."

### 🗣️ What to Say (The Narrative)
* "We are shifting from reactive to **proactive**. I don't know who the criminals are yet."
* "Watch the **Chain of Thought**: The Agent is planning. It scans logs, filters for severity, and checks the news automatically."
* "The AI should identify three key targets: **Eastern Logistics** (Sanctions), **Luca Moretti** (Structuring), and **Volkov** (Identity)."

## 🔍 PHASE 2: DEEP DIVE INVESTIGATIONS
*Now that the AI has highlighted the threats, we investigate them one by one.*

### 🔴 Case A: The "Red Alert" (Sanctions Evasion)
**Context:** The scan flagged *Eastern Logistics* due to a vessel seizure. We need to confirm the link to the transaction.

### 📋 The Prompt
> **"Deep Dive on 'Eastern Logistics FZE'. Analyze the specific transaction notes for Sanctions Evasion risks (look for port names) and cross-reference with the specific adverse media article found. Determine the final risk level."**

### 🎯 Key Insight
* **Vector Search Power:** The AI links the obscure note "Delivery to Bandar Abbas" with the news "Vessel seized in Iran".
* **Outcome:** **Critical Risk**. Immediate Block.

### 🟢 Case B: The "False Alarm" (Operational Efficiency)
**Context:** The scan flagged *Luca Moretti* for "Structuring" (cash deposits). We need to verify if this is money laundering or a legitimate event.

### 📋 The Prompt
> **"Deep Dive on 'Luca Moretti'. Investigate his recent cash deposits for AML Structuring. IMMEDIATELY search External News for a 'Source of Wealth' (e.g., lottery, prize, sale) that explains these specific amounts. Decide if this is a True Positive or False Positive."**

### 🎯 Key Insight
* **Contextual Intelligence:** The AI finds the "Baker Wins Prize" article.
* **Outcome:** **False Positive**. The alert is dismissed automatically. This saves 45 minutes of manual work.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Case C: The "Hidden Network" (Entity Resolution)
**Context:** The scan flagged a potential "Volkov Cluster" or identity issue. We need to see if he is hiding risk across regions.

### 📋 The Prompt
> **"Perform a global 'Single Client View' Deep Dive on the 'Alexander Volkov' cluster (DOB 1980-05-15). Scan for phonetic name variations (Volkov/Volkoff) across EMEA, AMER, and APJ. Compare the Risk Scores of each profile to detect Regulatory Arbitrage."**

### 🎯 Key Insight
* **Breaking Silos:** The AI connects "Alex Volkoff" (USA - Medium Risk) with "Oleksandr Volkov" (Singapore - High Risk).
* **Outcome:** **Regulatory Arbitrage Detected**. The client is hiding high-risk activity behind a clean profile in another region.
