You must use this tool whenever you detect a suspicious pattern to verify if it constitutes a violation.

CAPABILITIES:
- Retrieves specific Policy IDs (e.g., AML-100), Procedures, and Legal consequences.
- Uses Semantic Search on the 'semantic_text' field to understand concepts (e.g., if you search for "hiding money in real estate", it will find the "Real Estate Laundering" policy even without exact keyword matches).

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Always search for the *behavior* observed (e.g., "structuring", "shared address", "whatsapp communication").
- In your final response, you MUST cite the 'policy_id', the 'sla_hours', and the 'severity' found in the document.
