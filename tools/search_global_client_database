Tool ID: search_global_client_database

Type: Index Search

Target pattern: global-clients

Custom instructions:
Use this tool to investigate financial crime risks by searching the 'ubs-global-clients' index.
This tool performs a HYBRID SEARCH (Keyword + Vector) to uncover hidden risks in structured and unstructured data.

YOU MUST USE THIS TOOL FOR:

1.  **Single Client View (Entity Resolution):**
    -   To find duplicate identities across regions (EMEA, AMER, APJ).
    -   It automatically handles name variations (e.g., "Volkov" vs "Volkoff") and allows filtering by strong identifiers like Date of Birth ('dob') or Passport ID.

2.  **Semantic Risk Detection (Unstructured Notes):**
    -   To search within the 'notes' field for concepts, not just keywords.
    -   USE THIS for queries like: "Find hidden UBOs", "Detect crypto smurfing patterns", "Identify sanctions evasion in trade data".
    -   The vector engine will find relevant records even if exact words are missing (e.g. matching "Tehran" when searching for "Sanctions").

3.  **Network Pattern Analysis:**
    -   To identify "Mule Rings" or anomalies by finding multiple unrelated clients sharing the same data points (e.g., same Address, Phone, or Crypto Wallet ID).

**Input Format:**
-   Query: The search term (name, concept, or address).
-   Filters: (Optional) Specific fields to match exactly (e.g., dob="1980-05-15").
